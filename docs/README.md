# Metaburner Pro

**Metaburner Pro** is a Metadata Generator for Final Cut Pro.

> Metaburner Pro is currently being publicly beta tested on Apple's TestFlight.
>
> If you're interested in helping with development, you can learn more [here](/how-to-use/).

You can access it via a **Title** in the Titles sidebar.

Metaburner Pro gives you **25 text layers** that you can populate with whatever metadata you want.

You can even stack multiple Metaburner Pro Titles on top of each other for **unlimited** titles!

To begin, simply drag your Final Cut Pro Project from the Browser into the Metaburner Pro Title Inspector via a drop zone, and then Metaburner Pro has full access to everything that's in the FCPXML.

There's also a **Lua scripting environment** built-in, so you can even "code" your own text for unlimited possibilities.

You can even share Lua variables between multiple Metaburner Pro titles for some crazy possibilities!
