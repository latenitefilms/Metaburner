## Why FxFactory?

All our initial paid apps, such as [BRAW Toolbox](https://brawtoolbox.io), [Gyroflow Toolbox](https://gyroflowtoolbox.io), [Marker Toolbox](https://markertoolbox.io), [Recall Toolbox](https://recalltoolbox.io) and [Fast Collections](https://fastcolletions.io) were all released on the Apple Mac Store.

For Metaburner we decided to mix things up, and try out [FxFactory](https://fxfactory.com).

FxFactory has a number of benefits for us:

- FxFactory is a highly curated store focussed on editing professionals with a huge catalog of amazing products
- FxFactory offers free trials and watermarked versions
- FxFactory doesn't require Apps to be sandboxed
- FxFactory offers developers advice and code-level technical support/guidance
- FxFactory helps with user technical support
- FxFactory helps with marketing and promotion
- FxFactory has a number of technologies built into their software platform to make sure Motion Templates are updated correctly
- The FxFactory team are super smart and super lovely - you have direct contact with their developers/engineers

However, we've since added it to the Mac App Store too - for best of both worlds! ðŸ¥³

## Why is my Project's FCPXML so large?

The Metaburner Title contains a full copy of the FCPXML document that is dragged into the Metaburner drop zone or imported via the **Import Project via FCPXML** button.

It also contains "processed data" which is basically a database/table/lookup of EVERY frame in the timeline, and all the metadata for that frame.

This means that if your Project's FCPXML is 1MB without the Metaburner Title, it's probably 2-3MB with the Metaburner Title applied.

## Why is there a delay loading presets?

When you press the **Load Empty Preset**, **Load Built-in Preset** or **Load User Preset** buttons there can be a short delay (i.e. spinning wheel of doom) before Final Cut Pro pops up the success message.

Unfortunately this seems to be a delay in Apple's FxPlug - and not something we can fix or improve in Metaburner.
