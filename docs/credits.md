Metaburner Pro has been thrown together by [Chris Hocking](https://github.com/latenitefilms) at [LateNite Films](https://latenitefilms.com).

The Metaburner Pro icon was designed by the amazing [Matthew Skiles](http://matthewskiles.com).

Chris also created [CommandPost](https://commandpost.io), [Transfer Toolbox](https://transfertoolbox.io), [BRAW Toolbox](https://brawtoolbox.io), [Marker Toolbox](https://markertoolbox.io) and [Gyroflow Toolbox](https://gyroflowtoolbox.io).
